# Contract Creation Agent with CrewAI

This project implements an intelligent contract creation system using CrewAI, which automates the process of generating and reviewing legal documents through a multi-agent approach.

## 🌟 Features

- **Automated Contract Generation**: Creates contracts from templates with custom variables
- **Legal Review**: Automated legal compliance checking
- **Multiple Contract Types**: Supports NDA, Freelance, and Employment contracts
- **API Interface**: FastAPI-based REST API for easy integration
- **Database Storage**: PostgreSQL integration for contract management
- **Docker Support**: Easy deployment with Docker and Docker Compose

## 🏗️ Architecture

The system uses multiple specialized agents working together:

1. **Contract Writer Agent**: Creates initial contract drafts using templates
2. **Legal Reviewer Agent**: Reviews contracts for legal compliance
3. **Template Manager Agent**: Manages and customizes contract templates

## 🚀 Getting Started

### Prerequisites

- Python 3.11+
- Docker and Docker Compose
- OpenAI API key

### Installation

1. Clone the repository:
```bash
git clone https://github.com/yourusername/contract-creation-agent.git
cd contract-creation-agent
```

2. Create and configure the `.env` file:
```bash
OPENAI_API_KEY=your_openai_api_key_here
DATABASE_URL=postgresql://user:password@localhost:5432/contracts_db
```

3. Build and run with Docker Compose:
```bash
docker-compose up --build
```

### Running Locally (Without Docker)

1. Create a virtual environment:
```bash
python -m venv venv
source venv/bin/activate  # On Windows: venv\Scripts\activate
```

2. Install dependencies:
```bash
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

3. Run the application:
```bash
uvicorn src.api.main:app --reload
```
